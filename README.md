## Sofwate and UI:

* *TranmissionSetup*: python script with UI in order to characterize the optical tranmission of a device, with user choice of calibrating with the wavemeter the wavelength scan, and ftching the transmission losses with the powermeters.

### Prerequisites

* Python >3.4
* Most of the tools only work on **Windows** as the different drivers for the instruments are only provided for this OS. The driver are obvioulsy need to make these package work as we are directly sending commands to the instruments
* _as the setup.py is still a work in progress, you'll probably have to "pip" different python package_
