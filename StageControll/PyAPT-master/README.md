PyAPT
=====
Controlling Thorlabs APT using Python code using APT.dll and APT.lib, bypassing the activex controls.
It even comes with a simple GUI!

**Installation**

Obtain APT.dll and APT.lib from Thorlabs directly, or from the ```APTDLLPack/DLL/``` folder, picking the correct version (```x86``` or ```x64```)
Place APT.dll, APT.lib and PyAPT.py in the folder from which the scripts will be executed, or in the main add-on folder for python.
You also require ThorlabsAPT software (obtainable from [ThorLabs APT Software page](http://www.thorlabs.us/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=APT) )

**Running the code**

Ensure correct version (32 or 64 bit) APT.dll and APT.lib are in the folder containing the python script.
[```Example.py```](Example.py) contains an example of how to load the module, control the motor, and close the object.

**Using the GUI**

GUI is implemented using QT. First enter the serial number, and press the connect button.
The GUI will attempt to connect to the APT motor, and probe for it's current position and velocity. If sucessfull, those values will be updated in the respective boxes.
Pushbuttons under the position box are for movement in microns.

**Support**

PyAPT Supports the following motors:

Motor | HWTYPE | Description
------|--------|----------------
BSC001 | 11 | 1 Ch benchtop stepper driver
BSC101 | 12	| 1 Ch benchtop stepper driver
BSC002 | 13 | 2 Ch benchtop stepper driver
BDC101 | 14 | 1 Ch benchtop DC servo driver
SCC001 | 21 | 1 Ch stepper driver card (used within BSC102,103 units)
DCC001 | 22 | 1 Ch DC servo driver card (used within BDC102,103 units)
ODC001 | 24 | 1 Ch DC servo driver cube
OST001 | 25 | 1 Ch stepper driver cube
MST601 | 26 | 2 Ch modular stepper driver module
TST001 | 29 | 1 Ch Stepper driver T-Cube
TDC001 | 31 | 1 Ch DC servo driver T-Cube
LTSXXX | 42 | LTS300/LTS150 Long Travel Integrated Driver/Stages
L490MZ | 43 | L490MZ Integrated Driver/Labjack
BBD10X | 44 | 1/2/3 Ch benchtop brushless DC servo driver

I have no idea if it supports the KDC101. If you try it out and it does, please let me know so I can update it for others.

**Contact**

This is still a rough copy that I am improving as I work on my project.
Please report any bugs, and feel free to let me know of any comments or suggestions. 
*Please report bugs and questions by [creating an issues](https://github.com/mcleung/PyAPT/issues)*
That way, others can see your questions and contribute to them too.
Even better: make the changes and push them back to me!
